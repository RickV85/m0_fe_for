# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I would say that this has been the most challenging aspect of JavaScript for me so far. Partly because I was trying to learn while in a pairing session on the topic yesterday and because I had not yet finished the CFU on Conditionals and that was required to solve the third challenge (which I did feel that some sort of If/than logic was needed but didn't know how)

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I think I had a bit of both. Craig and I had some productive collaboration in our pairing session and that was helpful. We did start to hit a wall where we probably should have just left the session and done our own homework on conditionals before continuing. I think I got a bit frustrated after that and spun out into a much more unproductive struggle. I will say that it made my brain hurt a bit.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I want to understand how the function used to solve challenge three works a bit better by experimenting with it a bit more.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I'd like to hear an explanation of how the ".length" function can count the elements in an array and the characters in an element depending on how its used.
